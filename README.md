Calendar App that enables to add a new lesson and tag students in it. Built in Jetpack Compose, using Dagger Hilt for dependencies and Room for DB. I also used MVVM and clean architecture for the layout of the project.

# Main page - Calendar

This is the main page of the app, as you can see it's a calendar arrange by day. Each day can have diferent types of lessons, those lessons are organized by the start time and are dicided into 2 bloks: "Morning" and "Afternoon". If you click in the arrow buttons above the calendar, you can change the day ( < -1 day, > +1 day), and ultimately if you want to go farther than 1 day you can click in the center (the date) and a popup is going to open.
